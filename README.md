# riot-rpms
Riot (riot-web or riot.im/app) matrix.org messaging client built for Fedora Linux, CentOS/RHEL

Riot is a fantastic client for communicating using the Matrix.org protocol. But... it needed RPMs built for the Red Hat family of linux operating systems. So... here be it!

Included here are SRPMs and specfiles so you can rebuilt it if you like. But binaries have been built for these platforms:

* x86_64, i686 on Fedora 24, 25
* x86_65, i686 on CentOS 7 (which works for RHEL7 as well)

## Quick install instructions for the binaries
